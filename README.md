# Grand Piano

Grand Piano is a MIDI keyboard for feet, not fingers.
It is designed to be an interactive and intuitive music-making experience.

The keyboard uses force sensors and foam under each key,
allowing for a small amount of travel.
Each key lights up when pressed.
It can interface with a wide range of software, such as the included
web-based visualizer designed to be displayed on a large video wall
to provide extra feedback and interaction with users.

Compared to a typical piano, it is at roughly 157:1 scale
and only has one complete octave due to size constraints.
More octaves could theoretically be daisy chained together via MIDI
to create a full keyboard.
